In DNS for IPv6, these longer addresses are represented using hexadecimal notation, separated by colons. For instance, an IPv6 address might look like 2001:0db8:85a3:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555.</p> <p>AAAA Records: In DNS for IPv6, the primary record for mapping domain names to IPv6 addresses is the AAAA (pronounced \"quad-A\") record. This is analogous to the A record in DNS for IPv4. When you query a DNS server for the AAAA record of a domain, it returns the corresponding IPv6 address.</p> <p>Reverse DNS: Just like in DNS for IPv4, reverse DNS lookup in DNS for IPv6 maps IPv6 addresses back to domain names. For example, if you have an IPv6 address and want to find the associated domain name, you can perform a reverse DNS lookup using a PTR record.</p> <p>IPv6-Only DNS Servers: While DNS servers can support both IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack), there are also DNS servers designed to work exclusively with IPv6 without any reliance on IPv4. This is especially important in IPv6-only network environments.</p> <p>DNSSEC for IPv6: DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is a security feature that is fully compatible with both DNS for IPv4 and DNS for IPv6, providing security enhancements for domain name resolution in both IP versions.</p> <p>IPv6 Transport: DNS for IPv6 can use IPv6 transport exclusively for communication between DNS clients and servers, reducing the reliance on IPv4 for DNS resolution.</p>"},{"location":"A%20Crash%20Course%20in%20DNS%20%28Domain%20Name%20System%29/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>This wraps up our discussion of the DNS, which is a critical name resolution service for the internet. We talked about crucial functions of DNS, including mapping domain names to IP addresses, managing host aliases, mail server aliases, and reverse DNS lookups. The DNS hierarchy involves root servers, top-level domain (TLD) servers, authoritative servers, and recursive DNS servers.\u00a0</p> <p>Then, we discussed the two DNS resolution methods, iterative and recursive, which play a vital role in DNS functioning. DNS caching optimizes resolution speed by storing results for a set time. DNS Resource Records (RRs) store data in DNS databases, including various record types like Type A, NS, CNAME, and MX records.

The \"games\" (DNS Detective, Package Pro) are standalone static applications written in raw HTML, CSS, and JS. Symfony does not use Twig to render their inner logic. By placing the folder in <code>public/package-pro</code>, the web server (or the Symfony local server) serves those static files directly at <code>http://localhost:8000/package-pro/</code>. </p> <p>This keeps the frontend completely isolated.

We noticed that when we tried to seed the database, properties like <code>description</code>, <code>icon</code>, <code>colorTheme</code>, and <code>isActive</code> were missing, causing a fatal PHP error.</p> <p>Why: In Doctrine (Symfony's database ORM tool), PHP class properties mapped with <code>#[ORM\\Column]</code> attributes define the actual table columns. We added:</p> <pre><code>#[ORM\\Column(type: 'text', nullable: true)]\npublic ?string $description = null;\n\n#[ORM\\Column(length: 50, nullable: true)]\npublic ?string $icon = null;\n\n#[ORM\\Column(length: 50, nullable: true)]\npublic ?string $colorTheme = null;\n\n#[ORM\\Column(type: 'boolean', options: ['default' =&gt; true])]\npublic bool $isActive = true;\n</code></pre> <p>Note on <code>isActive</code>: We initially forgot the <code>options: ['default' =&gt; true]</code>. Because the database already had data (the DNS Detective row), adding a <code>NOT NULL</code> boolean column (<code>bool $isActive</code> without a <code>?</code>) made SQLite/Database complain: \"Cannot add a NOT NULL column without a default value.\" We fixed that by providing the default value directly in the ORM attribute.</p>"},{"location":"Training-Portal/Integrating-A-New-App/#chapter-3-running-migrations","title":"Chapter 3: Running Migrations","text":"<p>What we did: We ran <code>php bin/console make:migration</code> and then <code>php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate</code>.</p> <p>Why: Editing an Entity file in PHP does not automatically change the database. 1. <code>make:migration</code> compares your PHP files to your current database schema and generates a raw SQL file (<code>VersionXXXX.php</code> in the <code>migrations/</code> folder) containing the <code>ALTER TABLE</code> commands needed to bridge the gap. 2. <code>doctrine:migrations:migrate</code> safely executes that SQL file.

Typing them out by hand in PHP would be terrible. Instead, we: 1. Wrote a quick Node.js script to extract the <code>CASES</code> block from <code>app.js</code> and save it as a JSON file (<code>/tmp/package_pro_cases.json</code>). 2. Updated our PHP seed script to <code>file_get_contents()</code> and <code>json_decode()</code> that JSON back into a PHP array. 3. Created <code>CourseCase</code>, <code>Step</code>, and <code>Question</code> entities in a loop for every case we found.</p> <pre><code>foreach ($casesData as $data) {\n    // 1. Create the Course Case\n    $case = new CourseCase();\n    $case-&gt;app = $app; // Link it back to the main App!\n    $case-&gt;title = $data['title'];\n    $em-&gt;persist($case);\n\n    // 2.
